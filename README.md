A web interrogation tool for nosy jerks.

Hardly a new tool, but I felt the itch, and so it went. There are better, safer, more comprehensive tools out there to do this.

-   Interrogates a list of files and directories on a web server.
-   Dumps all the comments in the HTML.
-   Dumps additional file paths and domains found.
-   Calls optional additional handlers if a particular entry is found; for instance, it currently checks if `/xmlrpc.php` returns some basic info if `/wp-admin` is found.
-   The legality of this tool comes down to where you live and your personal ethics.
